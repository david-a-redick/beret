Description: A 2D puzzle-platformer game about a scientist, astonishingly named Beret,

 his solitary quest to overthrow the corporation and punish the evil deeds of his
 employers. Beret has 21 puzzle-filled levels, 120 collectable Medallions, over
 20 hours of gameplay, and an unlockable level editor.
